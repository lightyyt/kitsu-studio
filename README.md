# KitsuStudio
_A Unity project to parse and edit legacy Roblox RBXL files_

This Project is designed to be Cross-Platform and is tested and designed for:
- Windows
- Android
- (GNU/)Linux

## Platform Support

This project is designed to be cross-platform and has been tested on and targeted for:

- Windows
- Android
  
(Linux gets rarely tested due to me not having a Linux box, but it should still work!)
- Linux - Wayland _(Via WSL)_
- Linux - X11


## Planned Features
- RBXL Parsing  
- World Viewing  
- Part Editing  
- CFrame Editing  
- _(General easy-to-use API under `KitsuStudio.*` namespace)_  

## Features
None yet â€” I haven't even created the Unity project.

## Planned Support for Roblox (RBXL) Versions
- 2012  
- 2011  
- 2010  

## Supported Versions
None yet. See **Features** section for details.

## Note
KitsuStudio is an independent project and does **not** use any (modified) Roblox game files!  

Everything here is either created by me, contributed by other amazing folks, or based on open libraries.  

Legacy RBXL files are simple XML files, making them straightforward to parse!  

This project most likely **will NOT** support binary RBXL files, nor the newer (2016+) RBXLX format, unless significant time is invested.
